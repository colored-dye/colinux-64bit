Linux kernel 2.6.33.7: GCC-4.1.2
coLinux: GCC-4.1.2 with MinGW-3.14 and W32API-3.13

To build gcc-4.1.2 MinGW cross compiler and guest compiler, 
we first need a gcc-4.4.7 compiler.

The gcc-4.4.7 compiler is installed through Ubuntu archives
of trusty:i386.

Before building gcc-4.1.2, the source files require patching.
