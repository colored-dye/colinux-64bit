It is heard of that signing kernel mode drivers on Windows 10 and above is becoming increasingly hard. In the good old days, a kernel mode driver does not require signing to be loaded by a system like 32-bit Windows 7, XP and Vista.

So I decided to use Windows 7 first, and leave the signing problem behind.

This is obtained from "https://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-science/microsoft/67-microsoft-windows-and-office-iso-download-tool".

To run programs on Windows 7, we need to install vcredist packages, from 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015 to 2022.
